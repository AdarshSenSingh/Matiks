Understanding HectoClash: Real-time Competitive Mental Math Game
I'll help you develop a comprehensive plan for HectoClash, a real-time competitive mental math game based on the Hectoc format. Let's start by gathering information and then create a detailed plan.

Project Overview
HectoClash will be a platform where users can:

Participate in real-time duels solving Hectoc puzzles
Compete against other players with time constraints
Track their performance on leaderboards
Potentially watch other players' duels (spectator mode)
Receive educational insights on optimal solutions
Technology Stack Exploration
Since Go Lang is preferred, let's explore what technologies would work well for this project:

Backend: Go (Golang)
Fast, efficient, and excellent for real-time applications
Good concurrency support for handling multiple simultaneous games
Packages like Gorilla WebSocket for real-time communication
Frontend:
React.js for a responsive and interactive UI
WebSockets for real-time game updates
Database:
PostgreSQL for persistent data (user profiles, game history, leaderboards)
Redis for caching and real-time features (active games, matchmaking)
Authentication:
JWT with HTTP-only cookies for secure authentication
Deployment:
Docker for containerization
Kubernetes for orchestration (if scaling is needed)
Detailed Project Plan
1. System Architecture
Backend Components:
User Service: Handle user registration, authentication, and profile management
Game Service: Manage game creation, joining, and game state
Matchmaking Service: Pair players for duels
Puzzle Generator: Create random Hectoc puzzles
Solution Validator: Verify user solutions
Leaderboard Service: Track and display user rankings
WebSocket Server: Enable real-time communication
Frontend Components:
Authentication Pages: Login, registration, password reset
Game Lobby: Find opponents, view active games
Game Interface: Interactive puzzle solving UI with timer
Leaderboard View: Display rankings and statistics
Profile Page: User stats and history
Spectator Mode: Watch ongoing duels
2. Database Schema
Users Table:

user_id (PK)
username
email
password_hash
created_at
last_login
rating/elo
Games Table:

game_id (PK)
puzzle_sequence
status (active, completed, abandoned)
created_at
completed_at
winner_id (FK to Users)
GamePlayers Table:

game_player_id (PK)
game_id (FK to Games)
user_id (FK to Users)
solution_submitted
solution_time
is_correct
Leaderboard Table:

user_id (FK to Users)
games_played
games_won
average_solve_time
rating/elo
3. API Endpoints
Authentication:

POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
POST /api/auth/logout
GET /api/auth/me
Game Management:

POST /api/games/create
GET /api/games/active
GET /api/games/{id}
POST /api/games/{id}/join
POST /api/games/{id}/submit-solution
Matchmaking:

POST /api/matchmaking/queue
DELETE /api/matchmaking/queue
Leaderboard:

GET /api/leaderboard
GET /api/leaderboard/user/{id}
WebSocket Endpoints:

/ws/game/{id} - Game state updates
/ws/matchmaking - Matchmaking updates
4. Game Logic
Puzzle Generation:

Algorithm to generate random 6-digit sequences
Ensure puzzles have at least one valid solution
Varying difficulty levels
Solution Validation:

Parse and evaluate mathematical expressions
Verify all digits are used in the correct order
Check if the result equals 100
Scoring System:

Time-based scoring
Accuracy bonuses
ELO/rating system for competitive ranking
5. Real-time Communication
WebSocket Events:

game:start - Game has started
game:update - Game state has changed
game:solution - Player submitted a solution
game:end - Game has ended
matchmaking:found - Match found
6. User Experience Flow
User registers/logs in
User enters matchmaking queue or creates a custom game
System pairs users or waits for opponent to join
Game starts with countdown
Both players receive the same puzzle
Players solve puzzle in real-time, seeing opponent's progress
First correct solution wins, or best solution if time expires
Results displayed with optimal solution
Ratings updated
Option to rematch or return to lobby
7. Development Phases
Phase 1: Core Backend
Set up Go project structure
Implement user authentication
Create basic game logic and puzzle generation
Develop solution validation
Phase 2: Real-time Communication
Implement WebSocket server
Create matchmaking system
Develop game state synchronization
Phase 3: Frontend Development
Build authentication UI
Create game lobby interface
Develop interactive game UI
Implement real-time updates
Phase 4: Advanced Features
Leaderboard and ranking system
Spectator mode
Educational insights
Performance optimizations
Phase 5: Testing and Deployment
Unit and integration testing
Load testing for concurrent games
Deployment setup
Monitoring and logging
8. Technical Challenges and Solutions
Challenge: Real-time synchronization between players
Solution: WebSockets with efficient state management and delta updates

Challenge: Fair matchmaking
Solution: ELO-based system with time-in-queue adjustments

Challenge: Puzzle generation with guaranteed solutions
Solution: Pre-generate and validate puzzles, store in a puzzle bank

Challenge: Expression parsing and validation
Solution: Implement a mathematical expression parser with operator precedence

Challenge: Handling disconnections
Solution: Grace periods, game state persistence, and reconnection handling

9. Scalability Considerations
Horizontal scaling of game servers
Database sharding for user data
Redis clustering for caching
Microservice architecture for independent scaling
CDN for static assets
10. Security Measures
HTTPS for all communications
HTTP-only cookies for authentication
Rate limiting for API endpoints
Input validation and sanitization
Protection against common attacks (CSRF, XSS)


Next Steps
Set up the basic project structure
Implement core user authentication
Develop the puzzle generation algorithm
Create the solution validation logic
Build the real-time game mechanics
