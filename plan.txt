Conclusion
This comprehensive plan provides a roadmap for implementing the HectoClash project in a scalable and maintainable way. By dividing the work into logical groups and phases, we can prioritize features and deliver value incrementally.

The authentication system is already complete, providing a solid foundation for the rest of the application. The next steps should focus on implementing the core game mechanics and real-time features to create a minimum viable product that users can start engaging with.

As development progresses, we can add more advanced features and optimize the system for performance and scalability. Regular testing and user feedback will guide the prioritization of features and improvements.
